        <h4>Understanding How Facebook Disappeared from the Internet</h4>
        <p>
          “Facebook can't be down, can it?”, we thought, for a second. Today at
          15:51 UTC, we opened an internal incident entitled "Facebook DNS
          lookup returning SERVFAIL" because we were worried that something was
          wrong with our DNS resolver 1.1.1.1. But as we were about to post on
          our public status page we realized something else more serious was
          going on. Social media quickly burst into flames, reporting what our
          engineers rapidly confirmed too. Facebook and its affiliated services
          WhatsApp and Instagram were, in fact, all down. Their DNS names
          stopped resolving, and their infrastructure IPs were unreachable. It
          was as if someone had "pulled the cables" from their data centers all
          at once and disconnected them from the Internet. This wasn't a DNS
          issue itself, but failing DNS was the first symptom we'd seen of a
          larger Facebook outage. How's that even possible? <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/?fbclid=IwAR2R_jEAEhW4MbK5fqunAuVFEtmrZw4Nm60sjrWD85gTCPfnG_iwyvk7Av8">Read More</a>
