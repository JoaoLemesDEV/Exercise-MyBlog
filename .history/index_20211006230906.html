        <h3>Understanding How Facebook Disappeared from the Internet</h3>
        <p>
          “Facebook can't be down, can it?”, we thought, for a second. Today at
          15:51 UTC, we opened an internal incident entitled "Facebook DNS
          lookup returning SERVFAIL" because we were worried that something was
          wrong with our DNS resolver 1.1.1.1. But as we were about to post on
          our public status page we realized something else more serious was
          going on. Social media quickly burst into flames, reporting what our
          engineers rapidly confirmed too. Facebook and its affiliated services
          WhatsApp and Instagram were, in fact, all down. Their DNS names
          stopped resolving, and their infrastructure IPs were unreachable. It
          was as if someone had "pulled the cables" from their data centers all
          at once and disconnected them from the Internet. This wasn't a DNS
          issue itself, but failing DNS was the first symptom we'd seen of a
          larger Facebook outage. How's that even possible?

        <h3>A Complete Guide to Grid</h3>
        <p>
          CSS Grid Layout (aka “Grid” or “CSS Grid”), is a two-dimensional
          grid-based layout system that, compared to any web layout system of
          the past, completely changes the way we design user interfaces. CSS
          has always been used to layout our web pages, but it’s never done a
          very good job of it. First, we used tables, then floats, positioning
          and inline-block, but all of these methods were essentially hacks and
          left out a lot of important functionality (vertical centering, for
          instance). Flexbox is also a very great layout tool, but its
          one-directional flow has different use cases — and they actually work
          together quite well! Grid is the very first CSS module created
          specifically to solve the layout problems we’ve all been hacking our
          way around for as long as we’ve been making websites.

        <h3>This is CS50x</h3>
        <p>Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web programming. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. Course culminates in a final project. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. Two thirds of CS50 students have never taken CS before. Among the overarching goals of this course are to inspire students to explore unfamiliar waters, without fear of failure, create an intensive, shared experience, accessible to all students, and build community among students.</p>
